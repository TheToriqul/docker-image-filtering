## 📋 Overview

This repository documents my journey in mastering Docker image management through practical exploration of the Docker CLI's filtering capabilities. I've created a comprehensive reference implementation for efficient Docker image filtering and management, focusing on real-world scenarios and best practices. This project demonstrates my ability to efficiently manage Docker images in production environments while showcasing advanced Docker CLI usage patterns.

## 🏗 Technical Architecture

The project focuses on Docker's native image management system, utilizing Docker's built-in filtering and query capabilities. Here's how the components interact:
